<p>Some time ago I started learning WebAssembly as an absolute beginner. It has been an exciting but not so simple journey.</p>

<p>I decided to publish my continuous and probably neverending notices to make your learning path a little easier.</p>

<p>Here is the actual list of finished and planned posts. I will constantly update and extend it.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="/learning-webassembly-1-hello-world-of-wasm">Hello, World of Wasm!</a></dt>
  <dd>Let’s try WebAssembly for the first time. We will create a simple program in the Wat text format, compile it into Wasm binary, and finally execute it in a browser and as a server application.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/learning-webassembly-2-wasm-binary-format">Wasm Binary Format</a></dt>
  <dd>We will explore the structure of the Wasm binary format byte by byte.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/learning-webassembly-3-wat-programming-basics">Wat Programming Basics</a></dt>
  <dd>Finally some real programming! We will learn the very basics of the Wat text format, how to work with functions and variables, write conditions, and loops.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/learning-webassembly-4-wasm-memory-and-working-with-strings">Wasm Memory and Working with Strings</a></dt>
  <dd>The concept of memory objects is very important know-how in Wasm. We will use it to deal with strings.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/learning-webassembly-5-running-wasm-in-the-browser">Running Wasm in the Browser</a></dt>
  <dd>WebAssembly is part of the web platform, thus it is important to understand interactions between Wasm and JavaScript. We will learn about shared memory and global variables.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/learning-webassembly-6-running-wasm-in-nodejs">Running Wasm in Node.js</a></dt>
  <dd>Browser is not the only environment that Wasm can run in. We will also learn how to execute Wasm in Node.js, the popular backend platform, as well.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/learning-webassembly-7-introducing-wasi">Introducing WASI</a></dt>
  <dd>WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) provides access to several operating-system-like features from Wasm. We will learn how to write programs that use WASI.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/learning-webassembly-8-compiling-into-wasm">Compiling into Wasm</a></dt>
  <dd>There are plenty of languages that can be compiled into Wasm. We will take a look at some of them.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/learning-webassembly-9-assemblyscript-basics">AssemblyScript Basics</a></dt>
  <dd>AssemblyScript syntax is very close to JavaScript and as such is an ideal candidate to write Wasm in. We will explore the basics of AssemblyScript and create a few neat programs.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/learning-webassembly-10-image-processing-in-assemblyscript">Image Processing in AssemblyScript</a></dt>
  <dd>WebAssembly is a great fit for computation-intensive tasks like generating and processing graphics. We will experiment in this field a little.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/compiling-to-webassembly-with-binaryen">Compiling to WebAssembly with Binaryen</a></dt>
  <dd>Compile your own programming language to WebAssembly binary instruction format (Wasm) using Binaryen’s JavaScript API.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/2d-video-game-in-assemblyscript-tutorial">2D Video Game in AssemblyScript</a></dt>
  <dd>How to build a web-based video game from scratch with HTML canvas and AssemblyScript.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You are welcome to join me on the exciting journey of learning WebAssembly!</p>
