<p>When I added the creation of container images for our services into the build process, my colleagues asked me in the review: <i>"Where are all Dockerfiles?"</i> There were none. I didn't really need them.</p>

<p>In this post, we will see (and demystify) what an image is, how it is created, and which alternatives to Dockerfiles we have.</p>

<p>Let’s start with some definitions.</p>

<h2>Container Image</h2>

<p>An <em>image</em> is a way of packaging an application in order to run as a container.</p>

<p>There are several image formats for different container runtimes. In this text, we will talk exclusively about the <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec" target="_blank">OCI Image Format</a> which is standardized and supported by Docker.</p>

<p>An image consists of <em>layers</em> (tarballs that contain a filesystem bundle), <em>manifest</em>, and <em>configuration</em>. Optionally, an <em>image index</em> can be included for one or more platforms.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttulka/blog-assets/master/oci-image.png"></p>

<h2>Container Runtime</h2>

<p>A container is a way of executing processes with isolation provided by three Linux technologies: <em>chroot</em>, <em>namespaces</em>, and <em>control groups (cgroups)</em>.</p>

<p class="note">Note, that there are Windows containers, too. However, this text focuses exclusively on Linux containers.</p>

<p>Chroot can change the root directory <code>/</code> for the process, namespaces group resources together so the processes in a namespace can see only resources in that namespace, and finally cgroups can set CPU and memory limits for processes.</p>

<p><a href="https://opencontainers.org" target="_blank">OCI</a> provides a <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec" target="_blank">runtime specification</a> that is supported by Docker. However, there are different container runtimes such as <a href="https://github.com/lxc/lxc" target="_blank">LXC</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers" target="_blank">Kata Containers</a>.</p>

<p class="note">OCI reference implementation is <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc" target="_blank">runc</a>. It is a low-level runtime that actually creates and executes containers. Runc is a component of <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd" target="_blank">containerd</a> which is a daemon that manages the lifecycle of containers. Containerd saves and downloads images, manages memory and networking. It is used by Docker and Kubernetes (via the Container Runtime Interface).</p>

<h2>An Image from Scratch</h2>

<p>To demonstrate how containers work under the hood, we will create a super simple “distroless” image from scratch and run it by hand.</p>

<p><em>Distroless</em> means no operating system specific binaries like package managers or shells are included. Instead, we will create our own simple shell in Go.</p>

<h3>Penguin Shell</h3>

<p>To make the container a bit useful and easy to recognize we will include a small shell written in Go with commands <code>ls</code>, <code>cd</code>, and <code>echo</code>.</p>

<p>The program is a simple loop that reads the user input, parses commands and executes:</p>

<pre class="brush: go">
func main() {
  reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
  for {
     fmt.Print("&#x1F427; ")

     // read the keyboard input
     input, err := reader.ReadString('\n')
     if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
     }
     // handle the execution of the cmd
     if err = execCmd(input); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
     }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>The whole implementation can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ttulka/blog-code-samples/blob/master/image-from-scratch/penguinshell.go" target="_blank">my GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>It is important that all dependencies are dynamically linked because the program is supposed to run inside the minimalist container with no libraries installed:</p>

<pre>
$ go build penguinshell.go
$ ldd penguinshell
        not a dynamic executable
</pre>

<h3>Filesystem Bundle</h3>

<p>As our shell program has no dependencies we need only the bare minimum on the root: <code>bin</code> (where the shell binary will be placed into), <code>dev</code> (devices), <code>etc</code> (settings), <code>proc</code> (processes), and <code>sys</code> (cgroups, besides others):</p>

<pre>
$ mkdir -p image/layer && cd image/layer
$ mkdir bin dev etc proc sys
$ cd ../..
$ cp penguinshell image/layer/bin
</pre>

<p>Now, we can run our shell in the filesystem bundle with chroot:</p>

<pre>
$ sudo chroot image/layer /bin/penguinshell
&#x1F427; ls /
bin dev etc proc sys
&#x1F427; exit
$
</pre>

<p>Namespaces and cgroups are out of the score of this text, you can read more details in this excellent <a href="https://ericchiang.github.io/post/containers-from-scratch/" target="_blank">article by Eric Chiang</a>.</p>

<h3>Image Tarball</h3>

<p>In order to create an image from our filesystem bundle we pack the bundle into a tarball:</p>

<pre>
$ cd image/layer
$ tar -cvf ../layer.tar *
</pre>

<p>Now, we can simply import the tarball to our local Docker instance to create a new filesystem image:</p>

<pre>
$ cat layer.tar | docker import - penguinshell
sha256:cada8d0aacf0...
$ docker image ls | grep penguinshell
penguinshell  latest  cada8d0aacf0  ...
</pre>

<p>We can run the image right away:</p>

<pre>
$ docker run --rm -it penguinshell -- /bin/penguinshell
&#x1F427; ls /
bin dev etc proc sys
&#x1F427; exit
$
</pre>

<p>This is great, we have just created a local container running only our application with no other dependencies!</p>

<h3>OCI Image</h3>

<p>In the previous section, Docker created an image from a tarball for us. We can do the same without Docker. First, we gzip the filesystem layer:</p>

<pre>
$ cd image/layer
$ tar -czvf ../layer.tar.gz *
</pre>

<p>Then, we obtain the SHA256 digest for it, its diff ID, and size in bytes:</p>

<pre>
$ sha256sum &lt; layer.tar.gz
&lt;layer-digest&gt;
$ gunzip &lt; layer.tar.gz | sha256sum
&lt;diff-id-digest&gt;
$ stat -c%s layer.tar.gz
1303821
</pre>

<p>Next, we create a config.json:</p>

<pre class="brush: json">
{
 &quot;architecture&quot;: &quot;amd64&quot;,
 &quot;os&quot;: &quot;linux&quot;,
 &quot;config&quot;: {
   &quot;Env&quot;: [&quot;PATH=/bin&quot;],
   &quot;Entrypoint&quot;: [&quot;penguinshell&quot;]
 },
 &quot;rootfs&quot;: {
   &quot;type&quot;: &quot;layers&quot;,
   &quot;diff_ids&quot;: [&quot;sha256:&lt;diff-id-digest&gt;&quot;]
 }
}
</pre>

<p>And obtain its digest and size in bytes:</p>

<pre>
$ sha256sum &lt; config.json
&lt;config-digest&gt;
$ stat -c%s config.json
261
</pre>

<p>The last puzzle piece is the manifest.json file:</p>

<pre class="brush: json">
{
  &quot;schemaVersion&quot;: 2,
  &quot;mediaType&quot;: &quot;application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json&quot;,
  &quot;config&quot;: {
    &quot;mediaType&quot;: &quot;application/vnd.docker.container.image.v1+json&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;: 261,
    &quot;digest&quot;: &quot;sha256:&lt;config-digest&gt;&quot;
  },
  &quot;layers&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;mediaType&quot;: &quot;application/vnd.docker.image.rootfs.diff.tar.gzip&quot;,
      &quot;size&quot;: 1303821,
      &quot;digest&quot;: &quot;sha256:&lt;layer-digest&gt;&quot;
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

<h3>Pushing the Image</h3>

<p>When we have our image in the OCI format, nothing prevents us from pushing it into a Docker registry, <a href="https://hub.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a> in our case.</p>

<p>The process has three phases:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get the access token</li>
	<li>Push the image layer</li>
	<li>Push the config</li>
	<li>Push the manifest</li>
</ol>

<p>Phases 2. and 3. each consists of three steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Initialize a new upload and get an upload location</li>
	<li>Send binary data to the location</li>
	<li>Commit the upload with the digest</li>
</ol>

<p>For the sake of brevity, we will show only the pushing of the image layer.</p>

<p>First, we need to get an access token for the rest operations:</p>

<pre>
$ USERNAME=ttulka
$ curl -v -u &quot;$USERNAME&quot; \
  &quot;https://auth.docker.io/token?service=registry.docker.io&amp;scope=repository:$USERNAME/penguinshell:pull,push&quot;
</pre>

<p>After typing a correct password for the USERNAME, we got an access token as part of the response:</p>

<pre>
$ TOKEN=&lt;token-from-respose&gt;
</pre>

<p>With a valid token, we initialize the upload and get the upload location in the response:</p>

<pre>
$ curl -v -d &#39;&#39; -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN&quot; \
&quot;https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/$USERNAME/penguinshell/blobs/uploads/&quot;
</pre>

<p>Next, we send the content to the location:</p>

<pre>
$ LOCATION=&lt;location-from-response&gt;
$ curl -v -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN&quot; \
  -X PATCH $LOCATION \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/octet-stream&quot; \
  --data-binary @layer.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>At last, we have to commit the upload with the digest:</p>

<pre>
$ LOCATION=&lt;location-from-response&gt;
$ curl -v -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN&quot; \
  -X PUT &quot;$LOCATION&amp;digest=sha256:&lt;layer-digest&gt;&quot;
</pre>

<p>Repeat steps for config.json. After that, we push our image manifest:</p>

<pre>
$ curl https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/$USERNAME/penguinshell/manifests/latest \
  -v -X PUT \
  -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN&quot; \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json&quot; \
  --data-binary @manifest.json
</pre>

<p>After pushing the manifest successfully, we can pull and run our image from everywhere:</p>

<pre>
$ docker run --rm -it ttulka/penguinshell
Unable to find image &#39;ttulka/penguinshell:latest&#39; locally
latest: Pulling from ttulka/penguinshell
&lt;layer-digest&gt;: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:&lt;manifest-digest&gt;
Status: Downloaded newer image for ttulka/penguinshell:latest
&#x1F427; ls /
bin dev etc proc sys
&#x1F427; exit
$
</pre>

<p>Congratulations, we have just created a new Docker image from scratch without using Docker whatsoever!</p>

<h2>Building Tools</h2>

<p>We have seen that an image is just a bundle of files. In extreme cases, it could be even crafted by hand. However, there are more convenient ways to create an image.</p>

<p>Dockerfile, albeit quite low-level, is one of them. We can create the same image from above with the following Dockerfile:</p>

<pre>
FROM scratch
COPY penguinshell /bin/
ENTRYPOINT [&quot;/bin/penguinshell&quot;]
</pre>

<p>A Dockerfile is a bunch of instructions for Docker to build an image:</p>

<pre>
$ docker build -t penguinshell:dockerfile .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  8.141MB
Step 1/3 : FROM scratch
---&gt;
Step 2/3 : COPY penguinshell /bin/
---&gt; e1528c3ae6d7
Step 3/3 : ENTRYPOINT [&quot;/bin/penguinshell&quot;]
---&gt; Running in 80669d36fef0
Removing intermediate container 80669d36fef0
---&gt; 359870e7b0a8
Successfully built 359870e7b0a8
Successfully tagged penguinshell:dockerfile

$ docker run --rm -it penguinshell:dockerfile
&#x1F427; ls /
bin dev etc proc sys
&#x1F427; exit
$
</pre>

<p>This works fine for simple images like this one. For more complex images we would like to free ourselves from this low-level code.</p>

<p>Let us explore a popular tool for creating images without Dockerfiles: <a href="https://buildpacks.io/" target="_blank">Cloud Native Buildpacks</a> (Buildpacks for short) from the CNCF ecosystem.</p>

<h3>Buildpacks</h3>

<p>Buildpack’s job is to create an image from the application source code with a minimal setup and all necessary dependencies without any user interaction.</p>

<p>Buildpacks use two different images: a builder image and a base image. The former is used to build the application from source code and the latter is used to run it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of pre-configured buildpack builders to choose from. They are easy to integrate into the build process. Buildpack detects automatically which builder to use for a particular application being built.</p>

<p>For our sample application from above, we can simply run this Buildpack CLI command:</p>

<pre>
$ pack build penguinshell:buildpack \
  --builder gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:v1
v1: Pulling from buildpacks/builder
...
===&gt; DETECTING

Saving penguinshell:buildpack...
*** Images (e868002da2ce):
     penguinshell:buildpack
...
Successfully built image
</pre>

<p>As you can see from the log, Buildpack recognized our Go source code, built it, and pushed a new image:</p>

<pre>
$ docker run --rm -it penguinshell:buildpack
&#x1F427; ls /
bin boot cnb dev etc home layers lib lib64 media mnt opt proc root run sbin srv sys tmp usr var workspace
&#x1F427; exit
$
</pre>

<p>The base image is obviously different. It contains multiple layers and more files than the image we created from scratch.</p>

<p>In general, unnecessary functionality is a potential risk. In most cases, we can live with this risk as Buildpack base images are quite minimal. In the rest cases, we can build our <a href="https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/" target="_blank">own buildpack</a> specific to our needs.</p>

<p class="note">Note that for some kinds of applications we don’t even need the Buildpack CLI to be installed. For example, <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot-docker/" target="_blank">Spring Boot</a> integrates Buildpack in its Gradle and Maven plugins.</p>

<p>Buildpacks are not the only tool for building images without Dockerfiles. Some of them, like <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib" target="_blank">Jib</a>, do not even need a Docker engine to work.</p>

<p>You may also take a look at <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib" target="_blank">Jib</a>, <a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah" target="_blank">buildah</a>, <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/pouch" target="_blank">PouchContainer</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko" target="_blank">kaniko</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post, we have demystified container images by creating one from scratch by hand.</p>

<p>Also, we have shown other convenient ways to build images without a Dockerfile.</p>

<p>Now, you have a good starting point to build perfect images for your applications. The world of containers is extensive and possibilities are almost unlimited.</p>

<p>Happy containerizing!</p>
